## clustvarsel: Variable Selection for Model-Based Clustering

An R package implementing variable selection methodology for Gaussian model-based clustering which allows to find the (locally) optimal subset of variables in a data set that have group/cluster information. 
A greedy or headlong search can be used, either in a forward-backward or backward-forward direction, with or without sub-sampling at the hierarchical clustering stage for starting MCLUST models. By default the algorithm uses a sequential search, but parallelisation is also available.

- `clustvarsel` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=clustvarsel)
- Authors: Nema Dean, Adrian E. Raftery, and Luca Scrucca
- Package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clustvarsel/vignettes/clustvarsel.html)
- Webpage: <https://mclust-org.github.io/clustvarsel>


## GA: Genetic Algorithms

This R package provides a flexible general-purpose set of tools for optimization using genetic algorithms.
GAs search are available for both the continuous and the discrete case, whether constrained or not. Users can easily define their own objective function depending on the problem at hand.  Several genetic operators are available and can be combined to explore the best settings for the current task. Furthermore, users can define new genetic operators and easily evaluate their performances. GAs can be run sequentially or in parallel.

- `GA` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GA)
- Author: Luca Scrucca
- Package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GA/vignettes/GA.html)

## qcc: Quality Control Charts

Shewhart quality control charts for continuous, attribute and count data. Cusum and EWMA charts. Operating characteristic curves. Process capability analysis. Pareto chart and cause-and-effect chart. Multivariate control charts.

- `qcc` is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=qcc)
- Author: Luca Scrucca
- Package [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qcc/vignettes/qcc_a_quick_tour.html)
- Webpage: <http://luca-scr.github.io/qcc/index.html>
