This mixture model provides a flexible approach to model complex distributions that may not be easily represented by a single Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian mixture model with a noise component refers to a finite mixture that includes an additional noise component to model the background noise or outliers in the data. This additional noise component helps to take into account the presence of anomalies or outliers in the data. This latter aspect is crucial for anomaly detection in situations where a clear, early warning of an abnormal condition is required. This paper proposes a novel entropy-based procedure for initializing the noise component in Gaussian mixture models. Our approach is shown to be easy to implement and effective for anomaly detection. We successfully identify anomalies in both simulated and real-world datasets, even in the presence of significant levels of noise and outliers. We provide a step-by-step description of the proposed data analysis process, along with the corresponding R code, which is publicly available in a GitHub repository.","tags":null,"title":"Entropy-based anomaly detection for Gaussian mixture modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stéphane Robin","Luca Scrucca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1673913600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673913600,"objectID":"97f2e4417642da78b8a4a243ec0defb9","permalink":"https://luca-scr.github.io/publication/publication11/","publishdate":"2023-01-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication11/","section":"publication","summary":"The entropy is a measure of uncertainty that plays a central role in information theory.

Near real-time monitoring of the pandemic growth is crucial for policy makers and public health officials who need to make informed decisions about whether to enforce lockdowns or allow certain activities. The effective reproduction number $R_t$ is the standard index used in many countries for this goal. However, it is known that due to the delays between infection and case registration, its use for decision making is somewhat limited. In this paper a near real-time COVINDEX is proposed for monitoring the evolution of the pandemic. The index is computed from predictions obtained from a GAM beta regression for modelling the test positive rate as a function of time. The proposal is illustrated using data on COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and compared with $R_t$. A simple chart is also proposed for monitoring local and national outbreaks by policy makers and public health officials.","tags":null,"title":"A COVINDEX based on a GAM beta regression model with an application to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Scrucca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1649894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649894400,"objectID":"4703aee76d5c1495a8b5d70e510a486e","permalink":"https://luca-scr.github.io/publication/publication09/","publishdate":"2022-04-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication09/","section":"publication","summary":"PPGMMGA is a projection pursuit (PP) algorithm aimed at detecting and visualising clustering structures in multivariate data. The algorithm uses the negentropy as PP index obtained by fitting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for density estimation and, then, exploits genetic algorithms (GAs) for its optimisation. Since the PPGMMGA algorithm is a dimension reduction technique specifically introduced for visualisation purposes, cluster memberships are not explicitly provided. In this paper a modal clustering approach is proposed for estimating clusters of projected data points. In particular, a modal EM algorithm is employed to estimate the modes corresponding to the local maxima in the projection subspace of the underlying density estimated using parsimonious GMMs. Data points are then clustered according to the domain of attraction of the identified modes. Simulated and real data are discussed to illustrate the proposed method and evaluate the clustering performance.","tags":null,"title":"Modal clustering on PPGMMGA projection subspace","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alessandro Casa","Luca Scrucca","Giovanna Menardi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630454400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630454400,"objectID":"4206260154dc0bb1979d43983f0100c1","permalink":"https://luca-scr.github.io/publication/publication08/","publishdate":"2021-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication08/","section":"publication","summary":"With the recent growth in data availability and complexity, and the associated outburst of elaborate modelling approaches, model selection tools have become a lifeline, providing objective criteria to deal with this increasingly challenging landscape. In fact, basing predictions and inference on a single model may be limiting if not harmful; ensemble approaches, which combine different models, have been proposed to overcome the selection step, and proven fruitful especially in the supervised learning framework. Conversely, these approaches have been scantily explored in the unsupervised setting. In this work we focus on the model-based clustering formulation, where a plethora of mixture models, with different number of components and parametrizations, is typically estimated. We propose an ensemble clustering approach that circumvents the single best model paradigm, while improving stability and robustness of the partitions. A new density estimator, being a convex linear combination of the density estimates in the ensemble, is introduced and exploited for group assignment. As opposed to the standard case, where clusters are typically associated to the components of the selected mixture model, we define partitions by borrowing the modal, or nonparametric, formulation of the clustering problem, where groups are linked with high-density regions. Staying in the density-based realm we thus show how blending together parametric and nonparametric approaches may be beneficial from a clustering perspective.","tags":null,"title":"Better than the best?

Thus, clusters are closely related to certain regions around the density modes, and every cluster corresponds to a bump of the density. The Modal Expectation-Maximization (MEM) algorithm is an iterative procedure that can identify the local maxima of any density function. In this contribution, we propose a fast and efficient MEM algorithm to be used when the density function is estimated through a finite mixture of Gaussian distributions with parsimonious component-covariance structures. After describing the procedure, we apply the proposed MEM algorithm on both simulated and real data examples, showing its high flexibility in several contexts.","tags":null,"title":"A fast and efficient Modal EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Scrucca","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The negentropy obtained from a multivariate density estimated by GMMs is adopted as the PP index to be maximized. For a fixed dimension of the projection subspace, the GMM-based density estimation is projected onto that subspace, where an approximation of the negentropy for Gaussian mixtures is computed. Then, genetic algorithms are used to find the optimal, orthogonal projection basis by maximizing the former approximation. We show that this semiparametric approach to PP is flexible and allows highly informative structures to be detected, by projecting multivariate datasets onto a subspace, where the data can be feasibly visualized.

Nevertheless, since the number of model parameters scales quadratically with the number of variables, these models can be easily over-parameterized. For this reason, parsimonious models have been developed via covariance matrix decompositions or assuming local independence. However, these remedies do not allow for direct estimation of sparse covariance matrices nor do they take into account that the structure of association among the variables can vary from one cluster to the other. To this end, we introduce mixtures of Gaussian covariance graph models for model-based clustering with sparse covariance matrices. A penalized likelihood approach is employed for estimation and a general penalty term on the graph configurations can be used to induce different levels of sparsity and incorporate prior knowledge. Model estimation is carried out using a structural-EM algorithm for parameters and graph structure estimation, where two alternative strategies based on a genetic algorithm and an efficient stepwise search are proposed for inference. With this approach, sparse component covariance matrices are directly obtained. The framework results in a parsimonious model-based clustering of the data via a flexible model for the within-group joint distribution of the variables. Extensive simulated data experiments and application to illustrative datasets show that the method attains good classification performance and model quality. The general methodology for model-based clustering with sparse covariance matrices is implemented in the R package mixggm, available on CRAN.","tags":null,"title":"Model-based clustering with sparse covariance matrices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Scrucca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1555459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555459200,"objectID":"9bfc8e17bdf7fe374ed29d3244a9943a","permalink":"https://luca-scr.github.io/publication/publication04/","publishdate":"2019-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication04/","section":"publication","summary":"Finite mixture of Gaussian distributions provide a flexible semiparametric methodology for density estimation when the continuous variables under investigation have no boundaries. However, in practical applications, variables may be partially bounded (e.g., taking nonnegative values) or completely bounded (e.g., taking values in the unit interval). In this case, the standard Gaussian finite mixture model assigns nonzero densities to any possible values, even to those outside the ranges where the variables are defined, hence resulting in potentially severe bias. In this paper, we propose a transformation‐based approach for Gaussian mixture modeling in case of bounded variables. The basic idea is to carry out density estimation not on the original data but on appropriately transformed data. Then, the density for the original data can be obtained by a change of variables. Both the transformation parameters and the parameters of the Gaussian mixture are jointly estimated by the expectation‐maximization (EM) algorithm. The methodology for partially and completely bounded data is illustrated using both simulated data and real data applications.","tags":null,"title":"A transformation-based approach to Gaussian mixture density estimation for bounded data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Scrucca"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;)     print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;)  Welcome to Academic!

Variable or feature selection is of particular importance in situations where only a subset of the available variables provide clustering information. This enables the selection of a more parsimonious model, yielding more efficient estimates, a clearer interpretation and, often, improved clustering partitions. This paper describes the R package `clustvarsel` which performs subset selection for model-based clustering.  An improved version of the Raftery and Dean (2006) methodology is implemented in the new release of the package to find the (locally) optimal subset of variables with group/cluster information in a dataset. Search over the solution space is performed using either a stepwise greedy search or a headlong algorithm. Adjustments for speeding up these algorithms are discussed, as well as a parallel implementation of the stepwise search. Usage of the package is presented through the discussion of several data examples.","tags":null,"title":"clustvarsel: A Package Implementing Variable Selection for Gaussian Model-Based Clustering in R","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luca Scrucca "],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1494374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1494374400,"objectID":"79a3a72b398d86a4cf78475b269c16ae","permalink":"https://luca-scr.github.io/publication/publication01/","publishdate":"2017-05-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/publication01/","section":"publication","summary":"Genetic algorithms are stochastic iterative algorithms in which a population of individuals evolve by emulating the process of biological evolution and natural selection.

In particular, hybrid GAs have been implemented by including the option to perform local searches during the evolution. This allows to combine the power of genetic algorithms with the speed of a local optimiser. Another major improvement is the provision of facilities for parallel computing. Parallelisation has been implemented using both the master-slave approach and the islands evolution model.
